# FORMULA 1 Listings

## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to display a list, showing the FORMULA 1 world champions since 2005.

## FORMULA 1 Guidelines

This project is in accordance with the FORMULA 1 Guidelines [FORMULA 1 Guidelines](https://www.formula1.com/en/toolbar/guidelines.html) page. Therefore, no FORMULA 1 logos have been used, and a disclaimer notice is added.

As styling for this project, the FORMULA 1 Font Family and FORMULA 1 colours have been used.

## Project Instructions

* Wait for the page to load
* Close the disclaimer
* Expand the row for the specific year you want to view the race results for

## Project Notes

* Even though the project currenlty only consists of one page, a shared module was still created for future scalability.
* This project does not include an auth service, or any auth guards, since it is an "open" API that is used.
* No custom linting has been set up, and standard linting has been used.
* No custom environments or configurations has been set up.
* Since the project is so small, no state management has been implemented
* For the purposes of this project, Google Chrome's REST API caching is sufficient - but adding API caching in an HTTP Interceptor service will be required for better optimization.
